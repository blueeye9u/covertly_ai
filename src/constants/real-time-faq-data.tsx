        question: "Do language models (LLMs) provide real-time answers?",
        answer: "Traditionally, LLMs do not have real-time information because they rely on pre-trained data that may not be up to date. While some models, like ChatGPT, can access real-time search engines, most LLMs generate responses based on knowledge available at the time of training."

        question: "How does Covertly.AI provide real-time answers?",
        answer: "Unlike standard LLMs, which may rely on outdated information, Covertly.AI integrates with Google's real-time search API. This allows us to fetch the most recent and relevant information from the web, ensuring that responses are sourced directly from up-to-date content."

        question: "How does Covertly.AI compare to ChatGPT in real-time search?",
        answer: "ChatGPT uses Bing for real-time search because both are owned by Microsoft. In contrast, Covertly.AI uses Google's API, providing search results from a more familiar and widely used source. Our approach ensures that users receive accurate, well-referenced responses from Google’s search ecosystem."

    {
        id: "4",
        isOpen: false,
        question: "Are the real-time answers always accurate?",
        answer: "We retrieve answers directly from Google's API, ensuring that every response is sourced from live search results. While we strive for accuracy, no system is perfect—LLMs sometimes generate inaccurate or misleading information, known as hallucinations. If an answer seems incorrect, we recommend checking the provided sources or rephrasing the question for better clarity."

        id: "5",

        question: "Is my data secure when using the real-time answers feature?",
        answer: "Yes, your data is completely secure when using Covertly.AI’s real-time answers feature. We do not store, track, or log any user queries, ensuring full anonymity. When retrieving real-time search results via Google’s API, we act as a secure proxy, meaning your searches are never linked to you personally. Covertly.AI is designed with privacy at its core, ensuring that your interactions remain confidential and protected."
