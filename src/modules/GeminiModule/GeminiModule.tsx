        <li className='fs-24 font-bold dark:text-white mb-8'>1. Privacy Risks
          <div className='block text-base font-light mt-4 text-blackPearl dark:text-manatee'>{"As a Google product, Gemini inherits the company's extensive data collection and tracking practices. While Google emphasizes security, its AI models rely on cloud-based infrastructure, meaning user interactions may be logged, analyzed, and potentially stored for model improvement. For professionals handling sensitive data—such as legal advisors, healthcare providers, or financial analysts—this raises significant concerns about data confidentiality and regulatory compliance. Unlike fully private or self-hosted AI solutions, Gemini does not offer guarantees of true anonymity, making it a risky option for those who require airtight privacy."}</div>
        </li>
        
        <li className='fs-24 font-bold dark:text-white mb-8'>2. Single-Model Limitation
          <div className='block text-base font-light mt-4 text-blackPearl dark:text-manatee'>{"Unlike platforms that allow users to compare responses across multiple AI models, Gemini operates within the constraints of a single proprietary model. This limits users to Google's interpretation of data, reducing diversity in perspectives and insights. For professionals who rely on varied sources of information—such as researchers, journalists, or policy analysts—this restriction can result in biased or incomplete responses. A more effective AI solution would allow users to cross-reference multiple models, ensuring a broader and more nuanced understanding of complex topics."}</div>
        </li>
        
        <li className='fs-24 font-bold dark:text-white mb-8'>3. Moderated Interactions
          <div className='block text-base font-light mt-4 text-blackPearl dark:text-manatee'>{"Google's commitment to safety and content moderation means that Gemini prioritizes producing “acceptable” responses, even if that means withholding potentially valuable insights. While this approach helps prevent misinformation and harmful outputs, it can also lead to overly cautious answers that lack depth. Professionals in complex fields—such as cybersecurity, legal consulting, and medical research—often require detailed, unfiltered information to make informed decisions. However, Gemini's moderation policies may censor certain responses or avoid controversial topics altogether, leaving users searching for alternative AI solutions that provide more comprehensive, unrestricted insights."}</div>
